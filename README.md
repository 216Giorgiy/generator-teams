``` Shell
npm install yeoman --global
```

### Build the generator

On order to build the generator you need to install the Webpack as a global node module:

``` Shell
npm install webpack --global
```

You need to clone the repository or download a local copy and in the source folder install the node modules:

``` Shell
npm install
```

The generator is built and packaged using Webpack.

``` Shell
webpack
```

The bundled generator and the template files will en up in the `./generators/` folder.

### Use it in dev mode

In the `generator-teams-tab` directory use the following command, this will link the local copy of the folder as a global node module.

``` Shell
npm link
```

To revert the link operation:

```
