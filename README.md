## How to

### Install generator

All Yeoman generators should be installed as global modules. The generator is published to the npm registry and can be installed and downloaded using this command.

``` Shell
npm install generator-teams --global
```

If you don't have Yeoman installed it has to be installed as well:

``` Shell
npm install yeoman --global
```

### Use the generator

To create a new project using the generator, execute the following command in the command prompt and answer the questions asked.

``` Shell
yo teams
```

### Build the generator

On order to build the generator you need to install the Webpack as a global node module:

``` Shell
npm install webpack --global
```

You need to clone the repository or download a local copy and in the source folder install the node modules:

``` Shell
npm install
```

The generator is built and packaged using Webpack.

``` Shell
webpack
```

The bundled generator and the template files will end up in the `./generators/` folder.

### Use it in dev mode

In the `generator-teams` directory use the following command, this will link the local copy of the folder as a global node module.

``` Shell
npm link
```

To revert the link operation:

``` Shell
npm unlink
```
